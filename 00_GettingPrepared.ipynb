    "   1. Pressing `]` once takes you to \"REPL Pkg\" mode.\n",
    "   2. `activate .` should activate the containerized packages we need in this workshop.\n",
    "      - You should see this at the begining of the pkg mode now: `(JuliaWorkshop_Bahman1401) pkg>`\n",
    "      - This is a good way of ensuring everyone is running the same set of packages.\n",
    "   3. `instantiate` makes sure the packages are properly installed. This could take some minutes."
