    "The Julia ecosystem contains over 7,400 packages that are registered in the General registry, which means that finding the right package can be a challenge. Fortunately, there are services that can help navigate the ecosystem, including:\n",
    "- [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages) — a [Julia Computing](https://juliacomputing.com/) service that includes search of all registered open source package documentation, code search, and navigation by tags/keywords.\n",
    "- [Julia Packages](https://juliapackages.com/) — browse Julia packages, filter by categories, and sort them by popularity, creation date or date of last update. Also supports browsing package developers.\n",
