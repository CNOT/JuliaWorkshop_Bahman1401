# JuliaWorkshop_Bahman1401

These are the materials that were used in the online workshop of Introduction to Julia held at the Physical Society of Iran, Feb. 2023 (Bahman 1401). The notebooks are curated by me, but they are inspired or even sometimes copied from other Julia tutorials, such as the ones given by Jane Herriman. Some parts of the notebooks have been copied from this discourse thread: [Seven lines of Julia](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/seven-lines-of-julia-examples-sought/50416/135)
