# JuliaWorkshop_Bahman1401

These are the materials that were used in the online workshop of Introduction to Julia held at the Physical Society of Iran, Feb. 2023 (Bahman 1401). The notebooks are solely written by, but they are inspired by other Julia tutorials, such as the ones given by Jane Herriman.
